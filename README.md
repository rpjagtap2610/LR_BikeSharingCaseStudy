## General Information

- This project is an asssignment by Upgrad - Online Learning Platform.
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- Goal is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.

## Technology Used
Python
- Pandas library
- Numpy library
- Matplotlib library
- Seaborn library
- sklearn library
- statsmodels library
